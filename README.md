# Social_Media_App
Made using Django, with "allauth" and crispy-forms modules (With Bootstrap 5)

### Warning: There is still an issue where after you signup with your account, Render throws a "ConnectionRefused" error although the account is created. 

Once the error does appear, simply refresh the page and click on the "sign in" link.


The app has the following features implemented:
- Account Creation
- Account Authentication
- Post Creation
- Post Deletion
- Followers Count
- Follow & Unfollow Users
