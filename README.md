# Social_Media_App
Made using Django, with "allauth" and "crispy forms" modules

### Warning: There is still an issue where after you signup with your account, Render throws a "ConnectionRefused" error despite the account being created. The work-around for it as of now is the click on the host link again after you sign up to log into your profile.


The app has the following features implemented
- Account Creation
- Account Authentication
- Post Creation
- Post Deletion
- Comments
- Followers Count
- Follow & Unfollow Users
- Likes & Dislikes
- User Search
